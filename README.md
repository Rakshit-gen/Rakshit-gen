## 🚀 About Me

I'm a software engineer who loves turning ideas into real, working products. Whether it's architecting scalable backends, optimizing database queries, or crafting smooth user experiences, I'm all about building software that people actually want to use.

When I'm not pushing code, you'll find me exploring new tech stacks, solving algorithmic puzzles, or working on side projects that scratch my own itches (and hopefully solve problems for others too).

## 💻 What I Build

### 🎯 [Slanine](https://www.slanine.online/) - SaaS Productivity Platform
My pride and joy—a full-stack SaaS platform offering 25+ productivity tools that I built from scratch. This project taught me everything from integrating Stripe payments to optimizing API responses under 200ms with smart caching strategies. I integrated GenAI APIs to power AI-driven tools, managed PostgreSQL user data at scale, and learned the hard way why rate limiting matters (RIP my first AWS bill).

**Tech**: Next.js, PostgreSQL, Stripe, GenAI APIs, REST APIs, Docker

### 🗨️ [Qme](https://flyuphigh.vercel.app/) - Reddit-Style Community Platform
Built a full-featured community platform with posts, voting, media uploads, and complete CRUD operations. The real win here was integrating Redis caching, which slashed page load times by 42%. There's something deeply satisfying about watching load times drop from seconds to milliseconds.

**Tech**: Next.js, Redis, MongoDB, REST APIs

### 🔧 More Projects Cooking...
I'm constantly experimenting with new ideas—from microservices architectures to real-time data pipelines. Check out my pinned repos to see what I'm currently obsessed with.

## 🎯 What Drives Me

- **Performance Obsession**: If it can be optimized, I will optimize it. Shaving milliseconds off response times gives me genuine joy.
- **Building in Public**: I believe in learning by building and sharing the journey. Every project is a chance to try something new.
- **Clean Code**: Writing code is easy. Writing code that others (including future me) can understand? That's the real challenge.
- **Problem Solving**: From competitive programming to real-world architecture challenges, I love breaking down complex problems into elegant solutions.
