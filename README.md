## 👨‍💻 Who Am I?

AI Backend Engineer who has built and operated microservices handling **1M+ events/day** and powering platforms with **50K+ daily active users**. I design and ship production systems in **Go** and **Python**, optimize queries over millions of records, and build APIs that stay fast under load.  

What sets me apart: I focus on performance, clean architecture, and shipping features that move real metrics—like cutting critical query times by **40%** and delivering gateways with **sub-50ms p50 latency**.

**Current focus:**
- Distributed systems and high-throughput event pipelines  
- Multi-agent AI systems for real products  
- Deep performance tuning across DB, cache, and network layers
