## 👨‍💻 About Me
I’m a **Software Engineer** passionate about **building things that actually matter**.  
From **scalable backends** and **fast APIs** to **smooth user experiences**, I enjoy the entire journey of turning an idea into production-ready software.  

💡 Outside of code:  
I love exploring new tech stacks, solving competitive programming puzzles, and working on side projects that challenge my skills (and sometimes break my AWS bill 😅).
